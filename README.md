# blender-model-viewer

This will be a 3D model I created in Blender that can be viewed in a web browser using ["model-viewer"](https://github.com/google/model-viewer).

You can also try the AR mode when referring to it from the browser of your Android or iOS phone. You can display the model in the real world and enjoy it.
